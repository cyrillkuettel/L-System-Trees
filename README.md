[L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) are being used to generate the trees. 
It is fascinating to me that by just following a couple of very simple rules, something exceptionally beautiful (and complex) can emerge. 
How it works: Is basically a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols. So it's and iterative process. Each symbol can code for a specific rule on where to draw.
